Set of utility classes implemented in VBScript for Classic ASP.

## Development Stage ##
It is still in very early development stage and is being updated/enhanced whenever I have some free time in my schedule.

## Goals ##
Principally attend to a commercial ERP system I work on and also, serve as a study and experimentation base.

## Lib Organization ##
The set is being organized in packages, based on their utilities.
We have the following packages, so far:
  * [collection](CollectionPackage.md): Utilities to work with objects collections.
  * [tag](TagPackage.md): A tag reader, which can read a source string like an XML or XHTML file and create an object tree, similar to a DOM structure.
  * [database](DatabasePackage.md): Utilities to work with Data Base.
